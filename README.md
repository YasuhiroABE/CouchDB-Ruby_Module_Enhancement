======
The original Couch::Server class is introduced at Getting started with Ruby at Official CouchDB Wiki.

This enhancement provides four authentication enhancements for the Couch::Server class as the following;

* Basic Authentication
* Digest Authentication for Apache Proxy  (require 'net/http/digest_auth')
* SSL Client Authentication for Stunnel
* Proxy Authentication for proxy\_authentification\_handler

Get()/put()/post()/delete() methods are same as the original methods.
